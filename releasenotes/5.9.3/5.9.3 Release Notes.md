# Nuxeo 5.9.3 - New and Noteworthy

## Assets, Cases and Documents Collections

[Collections][1] are a folder-like document in which you can classify existing documents. Documents are not actually copied or moved into the collection, which only holds a link to the document in its original location.

[createCollection.png][2]

Collections are persisted, per user, sharable and are a great to provide bulk features such as:

  * Bulk validation
  * Bulk publishing
  * Bulk download
  * ZIP export
  * PDF export

Collections are a natural way of working among thousands of assets and documents.

## Nuxeo Drive iOS Edition

An iOS app, that can be installed on iPad (for now) and that allows the user to browse online or to take on the road the documents that belong to folders that have been selected by the user for Drive synchronisation. Typical use case is sales kit synchronisation for offline access. The application is read only, it doesn't allow to edit the documents.

## Full Screen Mode

You can now navigate through a document list in full screen mode.

## User Invitation

To enforce the security around user creation process, the default mode is now to invite users via email, and user is created in the system only when she fills complementary information, including her password. That way, password do not have to be transferred via email or parallel channels.

## Nuxeo Drive

The Nuxeo Drive folder can be configured. Currently it is:

  * Under OS X and Linux in the user home: ~
  * Under Windows: in ~/Documents (Windows 7) or ~/My Documents (XP)

You can now choose its location during installation.

We also added the possibility to suspend/resume the synchronization.

And Nuxeo Drive is now available on the installation wizard of the Nuxeo Platform.

## UI/UX

We change the way we display tooltips by using the jQuery library tipsy.

## Elasticsearch Page Provider

We've added support for documents indexation with Elasticsearch. When you install this module, all the commons page providers will query Elasticsearch instead of your RDBMS. When choosing this design (that remains optional), you'll benefit of a greater scalability (as being able to answer to more concurrent requests thanks to Elasticsearch scalability).

## Box.net API Implementation

The Nuxeo addon [nuxeo-box-api][12] is an implementation of the Box API on top of the Nuxeo Platform repository. It transforms the Nuxeo content repository into a Box compliant storage backend. Use cases of such an approach are:

  * Light integration on continuous integration chain for your Box development
  * On-premise setup of Box stored content

Don't hesitate to read our CTO Thierry Delprat's [interview][13] to get a better idea.

Here are some examples:

**Folders:**


        GET http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/box/2.0/folders/{folder_id}


looks like


        GET https://api.box.com/**2.0/folders/{folder id}**


**Files:**


        GET http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/box/2.0/files/{file_id}


looks like


        GET https://api.box.com/**2.0/files/{file_id}**


## Facilitators for Escalation Rules Configuration

Simplify frequent escalation rules use cases by providing some functions usable in the conditional expression:

  * timeSinceWorkflowWasStarted()
  * timeSinceTaskWasStarted()
  * timeSinceDueDateIsOver()
  * timeSinceRuleHasBeenFalse()

That way, the following current condition



    @{!(NodeVariables["last_reminder"] == empty) &amp;&amp;
     Context["taskDueTime"].compareTo(CurrentDate.calendar) &lt; 0 &amp;&amp;
     Fn.date(NodeVariables["last_reminder"]).days(1).calendar.compareTo(CurrentDate.calendar) &lt; 0}



would be replaced by:


     @{timeSinceDueDateIsOver() &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; timeSinceRuleHasBeenFalse(86400000) }


without having to deal with adding a custom node variable etc...

## Calendar Facet

We have added a calendar facet that allows to easily set Calendar objects in the repository. They themselves display events in a calendar style, with ability to bind documents to calendars and events. This feature is very useful on Case Management projects, where one wants to review cases on specific events. Thanks to this roadmap item, it is a matter of a few minutes to setup some calendars in your application! The feature is made available in the already existing nuxeo-agenda module.

## REST API Endpoint for Types and Schemas

We added a new REST API endpoint for document types and schemas. It can be useful when implementing something like a connector. See [NXP-14114][14] for details.

## Improve File Download with the REST API

We've work on the Blob property JSON representation. See [NXP-13616][15] for details.

Before:


    "file:content": {
                "name": "Nuxeo_Platform_5.8_administration_documentation.pdf",
                "mime-type": "application/pdf",
                "encoding": null,
                "digest": "4faa1208dbd8dce54db9174dabdec7db",
                "length": "11485973",
                "data": "files/80438e3b-48bb-42d1-9e08-9a0f54b8f945?path=%2Fcontent"
            },


Now:


    "file:content": {
                "name": "Meetup Docker.pdf",
                "mime-type": "application/pdf",
                "encoding": null,
                "digest": "f829ff57c289b60be5dd2c57adcf1d51",
                "length": "5980167",
                "data": "http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/nxbigfile/default/e596bd67-aaa5-4a43-a84c-bcf4850c4834/file%3Acontent"
            },


## Giving a Comment When following a Transition

This is something we should have done a long time ago but it's finally here. You can now pass a comment when following a transition. To do this you simply add a comment in the document's context map like this:


            doc = session.createDocument(doc);
            doc.putContextData("comment", "a comment");
            session.followTransition(doc, "approve");


## Elasticsearch Query Engine

We've added support for documents indexation with Elasticsearch. When you install this module, all the commons page providers will query Elasticsearch instead of your RDBMS.

Another interesting use of Elasticsearch is to do a bit of reporting on your instance use with Kibana.

[kibana.png][16]

If you [install][17] it, be careful to switch to PGSQL (or an other external database). For now the package removes the old lucene libraries required for the default embedded H2 database to run.

The default configuration uses an embed Elasticsearch but you can configure Nuxeo Platform to use another one.

Parameter | Default Value | Description
elasticsearch.addressList | localhost:9300,anothernode:9300 | point to one or many elasticsearch nodes.
elasticsearch.clusterName | elasticsearch | The cluster name to join.

## Store Password Hash in LDAP User Directory

Now you can store password hash in LDAP User Directories (it was already possible with SQL directories). You just have to use the _passwordHashAlgorithm_ option as in this configuration sample:

  <directory name="userLdapDirectory">
      <server>default</server>
      <schema>user</schema>
      <idField>username</idField>
      <passwordField>password</passwordField>
      <passwordHashAlgorithm>SSHA</passwordHashAlgorithm>
      ...


## Nuxeo.conf New Parameters

Parameter | Default Value | Description
nuxeo.path.segment.maxsize | 24 | Define the max length of the document name, which is mainly used to build the document path.
nuxeo.http.proxy.pac.url | | Proxy auto-config (PAC) file URL.
