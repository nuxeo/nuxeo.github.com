<h1>New features in DAM</h1>

<h2>DAM is customizable with Nuxeo Studio </h2>
Redesign from the ground up using ContentView, Layouts and widgets. It makes every part of DAM screen (Search panel, result panel, asset view) easy to customize using Nuxeo Studio.

<h2>Ajax Navigation</h2>

Ajax Nav and Story push state -> permlink -> share the url 

<h2>Permlink available for any Asset</h2>

<h2>Saved Search Managment tab</h2>
Every saved search are listed on an home tab. A subtab for dam, a subtab for faceted search. You can share those saved searches with other users using the manage/rights tab.

<h2>HTML5 PlaceHolder</h2>
You can use the HTML5 place holder attribute on inputtext and textarea. It's a widget property(placeholder property)/ it's an EL, always translated.

<h2>UI Framework</h2>


<p>Widget Label now accept EL expression. This allows you to have dynamic labels, see https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/NXP-11040</p>
<p>Ajax Event queue global by default. If no queue is specified, it's tied to the global one thanks to rich favces -> more stable pages ?XP-11136</p>

<p>Widget Actions</p>
<p>1- One can use automatic JS confirmation popup. If you add a confirmMessage property in the actions, it generates the appropriate js method + you can pass EL args. Here's an example:</p>
<code>
 <action id="JenkinsReportSendMail">
   <properties>
     <property name="confirmMessage">label.jenkins.sendMail.confirm</property>
     <propertyList name="confirmMessageArgs">
       <value>#{docSuggestionActions.getDocumentWithId(currentSuperSpace.id).getPropertyValue('jenkinsreports:report_email')}</value>
     </propertyList>
   </properties>
 </action> 
messages:
label.jenkins.sendMail.confirm=This will send an email to {0}, are you sure that you would like to continue?
</code>

 
<p>2- We have widgets that render actions. -> action types can blend different action types like a submit button, an outgoing link and an action that opens a fancybox.
Now you can merge them
NXP-11006 and NXP-11044</p>
<p>3- more granularity know if the action bar belong to the existing form/ or it's an independant action bar that holds it's own form to make sure
le contenu de la fancy box contient un formulaire qu on peut sousmettre sans soumettre le reste ou faire des nested form. NXP-9444</p>

<p>4- Control the ajax behavior of those actions. If one action does not support ajax (like download) , we can mix those actions in any order.</p>

<p>5- We try as much as possible to pass select action of content view to action bar widdget.(copy paste etx..) you can now open open fancy box on copy paste etcc button
Bulk edit anyone? DM edit dublincore on fancy box screenshot / same in DAM with new asset /?XP-11138</p>


<p>6- Ajax - component refresh issue. JSF cache on component that is not reseted on ajax actions. submit clear filter etc.. have to be reseted because it should
new api to do that NXP-11566</p>

<p>7- Safe edit - stay or leave page

Well continue to pass all elements of the page to layouts, widgets, 

<h2>Use tags in searches</h2>
You can now add tags in your search form. Wheter you're using the advances search form, any faceted search, a content view query or a query operation. It works because we've added tag suppport to NXQL/
