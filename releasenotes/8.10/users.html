      <h2>Nuxeo Web UI Beta</h2>
      <p><span class="release">8.3</span> <span class="release new">8.10</span> A new UI is being written for the LTS 2016. Purpose is to move to more recent standards and technological stack (Web Components and Polymer) and to take the opportunity to reboot the user experience. Some important steps around configurability are missing before reaching the 1.0 version. Yet a large part of the feature scope is implemented and robust. We encourage you to check it out yourself:
      </p>
<ul>
<li>Content browsing, with great new features in comparison with JSF UI, like recently seen documents</li>
<li>Content capture, including batch metadata edition and Live Connect</li>
<li>Workflows</li>
<li>Search, including new asset search screens</li>
<li>Document lists a.k.a Queues</li>
<li>Analytics</li>
<li>Preview and more.</li>
</ul>
Final release for LTS 2016 is to be expected for April 2017. Nuxeo Web UI is already available <a href="https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/nuxeo-web-ui" target="_blank">on the Marketplace</a> and you can check <a href="https://doc.nuxeo.com/nxdoc/web-ui/" target="_blank">its documentation</a> for more details.

        instance. The access is temporary and any access remains tracked in the audit log, based on the used email
        address. <a href="https://doc.nuxeo.com/userdoc/managing-permissions/"> Read more in the documentation</a>.

        <h2>Long Renditions</h2>
        <p> <span class="release new">8.10</span>Optimizations have been done on the way renditions computation are scheduled to avoid that a long one with quickly changing documents would monopolize all the resources all the time, preventing uses to get other renditions.
        </p>

        <h2>Bigger Resolutions for Picture Renditions</h2>
        <p> <span class="release new">8.10</span>

        reasons. In order to activate the traces display in error pages of Nuxeo, the dev mode has to be set (
        <code>org.nuxeo.dev</code>
        in
        <code>nuxeo.conf</code>
        or in the Admin Center.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="release">8.2</span> It is now possible to override the subject of the notification that is
