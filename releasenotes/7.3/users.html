                PDF Viewer
                </h2>
                <p>
                A PDF viewer has been integrated, based on the pdf.js lib. It provides ability to zoom, rotate, access to a specific page, as well as support the streaming of the pdf when the file is big, starting displaying first pages as soon as they are downloaded. The preview chain for office document now goes through pdf format for being able to use this viewer for viewing any Office file. This pdf viewer is made available via a simple URL that accepts url of the file to preview as a parameter.
                </p>

                File Dispatching
                </h2>
                <p>
                An abstract base class of Blob Manager is made available for implementing a storage policy and decide that some blobs are stored on S3 or locally, or on different on premise storage systems. The policy can take into account:
                <ul>
                    <li>The metadata of the document (ex: a flag "confidential" set to true, blobs are on premise, otherwise on S3)</li>
                    <li>The lifecycle state of the document</li>
                    <li>The characteristics of the binary (ex: videos are stored on S3, other files on premise)</li>
This allows to implement for instance hierarchical file system policies.
    </ul>
                </p>

               Media Content Publishing
                </h2>
                <p>
               A new  plugin has been added that allows to publish content on the cloud. Plugin is made to provide multiple target implementations. Currently, Youtube and Wistia are provided on. User can publish a video on one of those sites, get a link to the published asset, as well as get the html snippet for embedding it. User can also view from Nuxeo Platform the statistics of the videos (nbr of views). This is great for using Nuxeo Platform as a DAM repository and from there easily push your content online. One could also add for instance Slideshare, Vimeo, etc.. Do not hesitate to contribute !
                </p>

                <p>
               User is able to manage  its oAuth tokens via the Cloud Services section from where he can connect to different Cloud services, such as Dropbox, Googleplus, Google Drive.  It is also possible to share a token with other groups of users. This can be useful for instance with the Media Content Publishing, if you want to share a you tube or Wistia account with multiple users in your department.

               Web Authentication for Drive
                </h2>
                <p>
               A web window is now used the first time a user authenticates with Nuxeo Drive against a Nuxeo Platform server. This allows to use the same authentication protocoles than the one configured on the Nuxeo Platform Web UI, may it be an SSO system, SAML, Shibboleth, etc..

                </h2>
                <p>
              All file downloads now happen in the same component that tracks the downloads and log them in the audit trail. This is the beginning of a series of improvements that will happen around downloads.

            On the publishing tab, users can set publishing target preferences. We used to display only the name of the selected folder, we now display the path so as to know which folder it is exactly in case they all have the same name.
