     <h2>

                Live Connect for Google Drive / Dropbox
                </h2>
                <p>
                Live Connect allows you to create a content application that handles cloud files (Dropbox, Google Drive, in the future One Drive, Box...) as if they were local files. Files remain in the cloud but they are referenced in the Nuxeo repository as if they were stored within it. This allows the user to benefit from thumbnailing service, full text, conversions, etc. Live Connect for Google Drive also brings the "Cloud Edit" mode. Your application based on the Nuxeo Platform can provide the users with a direct link to the SaaS applications that you can use for editing Google Drive files (Google Docs, Office 365, Pixlr, etc.).
                </p>
     		<h2>

                PDF Viewer
                </h2>
                <p>
                A PDF viewer has been integrated, based on the pdf.js lib. It provides the ability to zoom, rotate, and access a specific page, as well as support the streaming of the PDF when the file is large, starting the display of the first pages as soon as they are downloaded. The preview chain for office documents now goes through PDF formatting in order to use this viewer for viewing any Office file. This PDF viewer is made available via a simple URL that accepts the URL of the file to preview as a parameter.
                </p>

                  <h2>

                File Dispatching
                </h2>
                <p>
                An abstract base class of BLOB Manager is made available for implementing a storage policy and decide that some BLOBs are stored on S3 or locally, or on different on premise storage systems. The policy can take into account:
                <ul>
                    <li>The metadata of the document (example: if a "confidential" flag is set to true, then store the BLOB on premise, otherwise store on S3)</li>
                    <li>The lifecycle state of the document</li>
                    <li>The characteristics of the binary (example: store video files on S3, and store other files on premise)</li>
This allows you to implement the right storage policy for your business rules, including setting hierarchical file system (HFS) policies.
    </ul>
                </p>

<h2>

               Media Content Publishing
                </h2>
                <p>
               A new plugin has been added that allows for publishing content on the cloud. This plugin can provide multiple target implementations. Currently, implementations for YouTube and Wistia are provided. User can publish a video either to the YouTube or Wistia site, get a link to the published asset and also get the HTML snippet for embedding it. User can also view from Nuxeo Platform the statistics of the videos, such as the number of views. This is great for using Nuxeo Platform as a DAM repository and then easily push your content online. One could also add implementations for other online publishing sites, such as Slideshare, Vimeo, and many more. Please do not hesitate to contribute!
                </p>

                <h2>

               Cloud Services management screen in Home and Admin Center
                </h2>
                <p>
               Users are able to manage their oAuth tokens via the Cloud Services section from where they can connect to different Cloud Services, such as Dropbox, GooglePlus and Google Drive. It is also possible to share a token with other groups of users. This can be useful, for example, with Media Content Publishing, if you want to share a YouTube or Wistia account with multiple users in your department.
                </p>

                <h2>

               Web Authentication for Drive
                </h2>
                <p>
               A web window is now used the first time a user authenticates with Nuxeo Drive against a Nuxeo Platform server. This allows to use the same authentication protocols than the one configured on the Nuxeo Platform Web UI, such as an SSO system, SAML, Shibboleth, etc..
                </p>

                  <h2>

             Logging of File Download
                </h2>
                <p>
              All file downloads now take place in the same component that tracks the downloads and logs them in the audit trail. This is the beginning of a series of improvements we have planned pertaining to downloads.
                </p>


                  <h2>

             Saved Search
                </h2>
                <p>
             Saved searches sort criteria is now saved. In next release, it will also be possible to edit it.
                </p>

                   <h2>

             Full path is visible on the the root selector of publishing tab.
                </h2>
                <p>
            On the publishing tab, users can set publishing target preferences. Previously, only the name of the selected folder was displayed. The path is now also displayed, to ensure the target folder is the correct one as intended by the user, and not a different folder elsewhere that has the same folder name.
                </p>

                    <h2>

             Allows you to set lifecycle state when using csv import.
                </h2>
                <p>
           In the CSV importer, it is now possible to define the lifecycle state the imported document should have.
                </p>

                <h2>

            Video Player can be used with any property.
                </h2>
                <p>
          You can use the native video player with any binary property your configured with Nuxeo Studio on your content type.
                </p>

  <h2>
                            Automation</a>
                           
                            </h2>
                            <h3>Class Filter on Automation Scripting</h3>
                            <p>
                                It is no longer possible to perform Java imports from an Automation Script, as a class filter has been added to the Nashorn VM. This has been done for security and maintenance reasons.</p>
                            <h3>Platform functions available in Automation Scripts
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                            You can use Platform Functions under the Fn object like in Automation chains in Automation script, as it has been added to Nashorn context.
                        </p>
                            <h3>Helpers Automation</h3>
                            <p>
                            An extension point has been implemented to configure new function helpers to the automation module:

                                     &lt;/extension&gt;

                                 <p>
                                 A new helper for HTTP calls as been added. It can be used to perform external services API calls right from an automation script. See <a href="https://doc.nuxeo.com/display/NXDOC/Automation+Helpers#AutomationHelpers-HTTPExamples">exemples</a> for our documentation.
                             </p>

                                <p>
                                A proxy api has been implemented on the Nuxeo Platform so you can use native Elasticsearch GET queries as documented on the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html">Elasticsearch documentation</a> website. The proxy will ensure that only those documents each end user has the right to view are returned in search query results. Thanks to this feature, Elasticsearch-skilled developers can add the Nuxeo Platform in their architecture and benefit from a secure and modular content store with an extensible content management user interface, while still implementing their front office with JavaScript ES sdk.
                            </p>

                           Elasticsearch Hints

                            <p>Elasticsearch hints have been added to NXQL and to the page provider object. It allows you to use native Elasticsearch operators in your query when using an Elasticsearch page provider. This will help you build content applications with fuzzy search support, phrase search, using specific tokenizers (arabic, chinese, phonems), as well as run geographical queries against the repository, such as searching for all photos that where taken within a scope of 5 miles around the Brooklyn bridge. It also allows you to hit specific index fields. Nuxeo Studio Content View feature has been updated to support the declaration of Elasticsearch hints (operator, analyzer and field).</p>

                    A new parameter in nuxeo.conf allows you to customize the address for which the server waits for a shutdown command.

                    <h2>VCS Full Text Search Enablement and Configuration</h2>
                    <p>Most of the production set up will now rely on Elasticsearch for full-text search. In that case you can disable the VCS full-text index computation by setting the following flag set to true:
                        <div class="embededCode"><i>nuxeo.vcs.fulltext.search.disabled</i></div></p>
                        <p>
                         
                         Alternatively, if you do want to use it, it is now easy to configure the analyzer language thanks to the following property: <div class="embededCode">nuxeo.vcs.fulltext.analyzer.language</div>.

                    The default backend for the audit is now Elasticsearch. This improves scalability when using Nuxeo Drive for a large set of users. It also allows you to store more information on each audit entries, such as the complete serialisation of the document. This new capability will be leveraged in upcoming versions of Nuxeo Platform.
